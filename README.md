# Arhitectura Sistemelor de Calcul (Computer Architecture) - Lab Homework 1
Problem statements 1-4 imply basic string and number manipulation, input/output reading
and writing, array and matrix handling in Assembly x86, using AT&T syntax.

1. Machine code parser and translator: given a hexadecimal string, print the 
corresponding translated pseudocode assembly instruction to the screen.

2. Pseudocode assembly executor (without variables): given a string containing pseudocode
assembly instructions which do not make use of variables, print the result of said
instructions to the screen.

3. Pseudocode assembly executor (with variables): the same previous problem statement, but
given a string of instructions that make use of variables. 

4. Pseudocode assembly executor involving basic matrix operations
